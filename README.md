# QMK Design

Charlie Lees

QMK Design is a web app to design QMK firmware for a contiguous* keyboard using a GUI rather than programming it all by hand.\
Both the front and back-end servers are linked within this repository as sub-modules.

<ins>Frontend</ins>
* Built in TypeScript using Vite.
* Run with the Docker Image within the Frontend repository.

<ins>Backend</ins>
* Built in Python
* Hosted using AWS DynamoDB, AWS S3 Buckets, and AWS Lambda.




------
\*I hope to add split keyboard functionality eventually
