# QMK Design

Charlie Lees

This project is for a nice GUI to design a ZMK or QMK keyboard using a web GUI.\
This is just a personal project (and an excuse for me to buy more keyboards which use both QMK and ZMK)


[Frontend Repository](https://github.com/charleswlees/qmkdesign-frontend)
* Rather not do this in React.js again
* Maybe just do it for repetition sake, but not sure

[Backend Repository](https://github.com/charleswlees/qmkdesign-backend)
* Thinking of doing this in Golang
* I had a good time fooling around with Gin but there are other backend frameworks for Golang
